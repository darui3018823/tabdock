## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue.**  
Instead, report it privately using one of the following methods:

- Use the contact form at: [https://daruks.com/contact/](https://daruks.com/contact/)  
- Or use any other preferred private communication method

We typically respond within **24 hours** of receiving a vulnerability report.  
Once the issue is confirmed, we will begin working on a fix as quickly as possible based on its severity.

## Disclosure Policy (Optional)

After a vulnerability is resolved, we will publish a **security advisory** that includes a summary of the issue, its potential impact, and the fix.
